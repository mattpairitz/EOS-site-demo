# public_html
A few examples of webpages you can host through an EOS account.

# How To
1) Either log into an EOS computer or ssh into the EOS lab. Open a terminal.
2) Run this command in the Desktop directory: 'git clone https://github.com/mattpairitz/public-html.git'
3) If you run into an issue with ssh keys look [here](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/#generating-a-new-ssh-key) or [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Generating-Your-SSH-Public-Key)
4) There should now be a 'public_html' folder on your desktop. Navigate to 'www.cis.gvsu.edu/~username/' where username is your username and the index.html should display.
5) If you get a message saying access is forbidden run this to change file permissions: chmod 755 *filename*
